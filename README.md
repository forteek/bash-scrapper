### Picture waking up one day to learn that [bash.org.pl](http://bash.org.pl) isn't there anymore.  
As I was reading the top 100 pages, as I do annually, it struck me, that every year might be the last one to do so.  
Whenever there's a freightening thought, there's a simple python solution - and so, I wrote the following [bash.org.pl](http://bash.org.pl) scrapper.

### Setup
1. Clone the repo  
`git checkout https://github.com/forteek/bash-scrapper.git`
2. Install the dependencies  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a config.py file and review it's content  
`cp config.py.dist config.py`
